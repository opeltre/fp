funprogram
==========

Welcome to the `fp`_ package documentation! 

This lightweight library aims at providing a functional-language-like 
interface to the industrial-grade computation backends the python ecosystem benefits from, 
namely `jax`_, `torch`_ and `numpy`_. 

* 📦 install with `pip install funprogram` ✨
* 📝 the `manual`_ will get you started with the basics of `fp` 🛩️
* 📚 the `docstrings`_ may grant you deeper understanding of the internals ⚙️

See the `fp`_ repository on more details on installation options. 

This package is still under development.
We hope that you'll give it a try, whether you're familiar with functional programming or not!
